  Hello! Through out my career, I've worked as an Integration Engineer, developer, SQA and Support Engineer. This is because I love learning new technologies and providing solutions using modern technology. I have been part of Digital Financial Systems, Transmission & ERP teams and worked on different stages in SDLC. I enjoy working on databases and performing analysis. I also have exposure in interfacing systems to another and writing automated scripts be it in bash/python/c#. I am most skilled in: Integration, SQL and Automation scripting

          Slow speeds as it uses heroku and firebase for free.
        description: |
          This project had the aim of learning about deploying simple apps for free and to demonstrate my skill set. Of course, the speed is slow because Heroku puts free dynos on idle mode.
          Node JS for the backend Heroku deployment.
          React JS for Netlify frontend demo.
          Firebase for storing the data.

          A unique variant of the classic Pac-Man with the goal of getting my first steps into JavaScript. The final product is quite impressive, having in mind there were no third party libraries involved, this was my first time I ever used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and most of the art was drawn by me!
          After a while I decided to rebuild the project with a library called "Phaser" and the result was much smoother but I couldn't finish the project because of other duties.
          There are two demos, the old and the new versions, that can be tried in your browse and they are linked in the GitHub Repository!
