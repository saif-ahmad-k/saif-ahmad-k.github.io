  "Hello! Through out my career, I've worked as an Integration Engineer, developer, SQA and Support Engineer. This is because I love learning new technologies and providing solutions using modern technology. I have been part of Digital Financial Systems, Transmission & ERP teams and worked on different stages in SDLC. I enjoy working on databases and performing analysis. I also have exposure in interfacing systems to another and writing automated scripts be it in bash/python/c#.
  I am most skilled in: Integration, SQL and Automation scripting"
