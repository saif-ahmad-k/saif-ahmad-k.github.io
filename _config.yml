  Hello! Through out my career, I've worked as an Integration Engineer, developer, SQA and Support Engineer. This is because I love learning new technologies and providing solutions using modern technology.

I also have exposure in interfacing systems to another and writing automated scripts be it in bash/python/c#. I am most skilled in: Integration, SQL and Automation scripting
